Writing programming interview questions hasn't made me rich. Maybe trading
Apple stocks will.

Suppose we could access yesterday's stock prices as a list, where:

    The indices are the time in minutes past trade opening time, which was
    9:30am local time. The values are the price in dollars of Apple stock at
    that time.

So if the stock cost $500 at 10:30am, stock_prices_yesterday[60] = 500.

Write an efficient function that takes stock_prices_yesterday and returns the
best profit I could have made from 1 purchase and 1 sale of 1 Apple stock
yesterday.

For example:

    stock_prices_yesterday = [10, 7, 5, 8, 11, 9]

    get_max_profit(stock_prices_yesterday)
    # Returns 6 (buying for $5 and selling for $11)

No "shorting"â€”you must buy before you sell. You may not buy and sell in the
same time step (at least 1 minute must pass).

def get_max_profit(stock_prices):
    """Find the maximum possible profit, given the prices for the day.

        Runs in O(n) time and space.

        >>> get_max_profit([10, 7, 5, 11, 9, 4])
